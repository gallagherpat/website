            <p>The short story is we met on tinder... The long is a little more fun. Kenna was moving into college in Philidelphia and had stopped in North Carolina where her dad was staying for work. I talked to her and asked her on a date. She couldnt because she was leaving the day I asked. We then proceeded to talk all summer and finally went on our first date in August despite her parents misgivings :)</p>
