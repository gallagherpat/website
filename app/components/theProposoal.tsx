            <p>This is another fun story. It was a pretty typical day, Kenna and I were both at work and we were texting about how what we were going to have for dinner. Then her coworker asked if we could watch her dog for the evening. That is when Kenna suggested we go on a picnic! That is when I sprung into action and got all the picninc gear and the ring, and we got engaged in the park just her and I... and Rudy the dog.</p>
